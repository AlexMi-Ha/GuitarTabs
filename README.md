# Guitar Tabs 
🎵🎵🎵
This repository is used to store my collection of Guitar Tabs that I collected and transcribed over the years.

The tab files always contain Guitar Tabs and a lot of the times also the drum track, bass track, vocal track and other instruments.

To open the Files you can use programms like [Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com/) or the open source programm [TuxGuitar](http://tuxguitar.com.ar/) ([Tux on Github](https://github.com/pcarmona79/tuxguitar))

Keep on Rocking 🎵🎵🎵
